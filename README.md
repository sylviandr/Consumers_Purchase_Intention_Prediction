## SECTION 1 - Data Cleaning

***The main aim of Data Cleaning is to identify and remove errors & duplicate data, in order to create a reliable dataset. This improves the quality of the training data for analytics and enables accurate decision-making.*** 

   We have to analyze each feature, especially each feature against our target variable, Revenue. we need to identify and remove errors & duplicate data, in        order to create a reliable dataset. So, we can find out and predict what features can provide the potential for greater revenue due to the final consumer decision to make a product purchase.
